## TABLEâ…¡ BPMN++ Questionnaire
 This experimental questionnaire consists of five questions, and in order to quantitatively analyze the target metrics, five answers (representing the level of agreement with the question) are set for each question, and each answer has a corresponding score. Specifically, as shown in Table II for the BPMN++ usage questionnaire, these four questions correspond to the ease of use, applicability, readability, and completeness of BPMN++.
